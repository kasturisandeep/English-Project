guys 
Present condition in chennai:
It is really bad in chennai.In most part of the city the bore wells,lakes and all 4 reservoirs have dried up.In the few places where they are able to get some ground water,it is either polluted with sea water or seawage or is very muddy and brown.Many people in the city have been buying water in tankers but for this also one has to book and pay double of what it used to cost.
Many workers in the office are suffering so badly that they had to use the office facilities for a couple of days before finding alternate source of water.Almost all socities are rationing water.So,the government alloted timings for water supply i.e.two hours in the morning and an hour in the evening.
Inspite of all the above issues,chenna in the past had somehow survived.But this year,nature too joined the party.
Besides this,IT companies have started asking employees to bring their own water.Even school students are told to bring their own water bottles and even some restaurantsa are closed.
So,chennai is on its own way to facing it's worst water crisis
